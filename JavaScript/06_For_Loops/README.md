# For Loops

- To perform repeated actions , to automate tasks

## Types of Loops
- The for loop
    - ```js
        for (statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3) {
                // code to be executed
            }
        ```
    - statement 1 is executed one time
    - statement 2 is condition based on which loop runs
    - statement 3 is executed everytime the loop body gets executed
    - ```js
        // Program to add first n natural numbers
        let sum = 0 ;
        let n = 100;

        for (let i = 1 ; i <= n ; i ++) {

            console.log(i);
            sum += i ;
            console.log("sum of first "+ i +" Natural number is", sum);
        }
        ```
- For in Loop
    - works on objects and arrays
    - ```js
        // For in loop

        let obj = {
            kalyan : 10,
            kiran : 8,
            suma : 5,
            raj : 9
        }
        for (let a in obj) {
            console.log("Keys of obj are " + a + ", Values are " + obj[a]);
        }
        ```
- For off loop
    - works on strigs and arrays , they should be iterable
    - ```js
        // For off loop th obj should be iterarable like string or array
        // Works on arrays and strings
        for (let b of "kalyan") {
            console.log(b);
        }
        ```
