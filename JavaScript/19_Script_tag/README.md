# Script tags
- Why to use muliple script tags
    - code can be split in to multiple files
    - if files are not changed it will not load already loaded js
        - This is called ***browser Caching***

- Two ways of running js
    - giving a file
        - ```html
            <script src="script.js"></script>
            ```

    - writing code in script tag
        - ```html
            <script>
                // I can write js code here
                console.log("Code from inside the tag")
            </script>
            ```
    - Both cannot be done at same time
        - ```html
            <script src="script.js">
                console.log("Trying to executr both") // This is ignored
            </script>
            ```
