# Excerise 1 - Guess the number

- Write a Javascript program to generate a random number ad store it in a variable . The program then takes an input from the user to tell them whether the guesss was correcr , greater or lesser than the original number
- 100 (number of guesses) is the score of the user , The program is expected to termiante once the number is gussed , Number should be between 1-100
- ```js
    let rand_number = Math.random()*100
    let input_number = prompt("Enter a number")
    input_number = Number.parseInt(input_number)
    let guess_count = 100
    while (input_number !== rand_number) {
        guess_count -= 1
        if (guess_count == 0) {console.log("Your guesses are over"); break}
        if (input_number > rand_number) {
            console.log("Your number is greater than the correct number")
        } else {
            console.log("Your number is less than the correct number")
        }
        console.log("You have " + guess_count + "guesses left")
        
    }
    console.log("You have guesses the number in "+ 100 - guess_count)
    ```
